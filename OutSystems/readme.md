## OutSystems SmartHome

The video **OutSystems_SmartHome.mp4** showcases an application for a smart home system. This application originated from an academic project during a postgraduate course, where it was initially developed in Java. Later, I decided to restart the project and implement it from scratch using OutSystems.

The application aims to configure a smart home with various devices (such as refrigerators, air conditioners, or even switches). Each device can optionally include sensors or actuators.
